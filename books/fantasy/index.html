title: Good introductory fantasy
---

<p>
  So you like sci-fi and want to try some fantasy books but are kinda allergic to elves and Tolkien.
  Where to start?
</p>

<p>
  Well, here are some things you could try. It's a list of books I selected roughly for covering a wide
  spectrum while being enjoyable reads with solid world building and a relative paucity of the standard
  fantasy tropes (all guaranteed 100% elf free). It's very much not intended to be a selection of great
  literature, though some of them are pretty good.
</p>

<h3>The Chalion series by Lois McMaster Bujold</h3>

<p>
  "The Curse of Chalion" and "The Paladin of Souls". I actually don't remember this series all that
  well, but it's good (Bujold is generally excellent), fairly political fantasy with a modest
  amount of magic (magic is a major plot point, but there's a shortage of people throwing fireballs
  around) and absolutely zero elves.
</p>

<h3>The Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson</h3>
<p>
  Action heavy save-the-world-from-the-dark-overlord fantasy. Probably the closest to a Tolkien
  derivative on the list, but closer to a deconstruction than a derivative. Very well thought out
  world building (it's one of Brandon Sanderson's strength) and lots of violence.
</p>

<h3>The PC Peter Grant series by Ben Aaronovitch</h3>

<p>
  Now in the other end of fantasy - urban fantasy. Meet PC Peter Grant. He's a cop! But he's also a wizard!
  Crime solving and a modern genre savvy character who has been introduced to magic once he was an
  adult and spends a lot of his time (when not solving crimes) trying to figure out how the
  fuck it actually works. Steeped in lots of lovely detail about London (only some of it fictional).
</p>

<h3>The Kate Daniels series by Ilona Andrews</h3>
<p>
  Post-apocalyptic urban fantasy. Vampires and Werewolves (the former non-traditional, the latter
  pretty standard). Another action heavy recommendation. Interesting collection of sometimes deeply
  flawed characters. A great deal of violence, often dealt out by the very large sword the
  protagonist (Kate Daniels) wields.
</p>

<h3>The Parasol Protectorate series by Gail Carriger</h3>

<p>
  Super adorable steampunk. Also contains vampires and werewolves. The protagonist suffers from
  several disadvantages in polite society - she's half-italian, far too strong minded for her
  gender, and unfortunately finds herself lacking a soul. She rarely lets these stop her.
</p>

<p>
  Everyone I've recommended these to has gone from "Oh god are you serious?" to "THESE ARE AMAZING".
</p>

<h3>Chronicles of an Age of Darkness by Hugh Cook</h3>

<p>
  There's nothing else like this series. It's also out of print so may be hard to find.
  Vast sprawling multiple viewpoint hybrid sci-fi and fantasy. Well worth reading.
</p>

<h3>The Farsala trilogy by Hilari Bell</h3>
<p>
  The evil empire is invading, and a hero must rise to defend against it.
</p>

<p>
  Only... the hero in question doesn't actually exist, and the evil empire turns out to
  be really a lot less bad than some of our allies.
</p>

<p>
  Very enjoyable little series deconstructing how myths get made. Manages to include lots
  of shades of grey while avoiding everything being grimdark and terrible.
</p>

<h3>The Farseer series by Robin Hobb</h3>
<p>Our protagonist, Fitz, is a royal bastard who gets trained up as an assassin.</p>

<p>
  He's also the author's chew toy. Honestly by the end of the series you just
  want to wrap him up in a blanket and give him a big hug. Sure, a lot of it is his own
  damn fault, but the poor guy just can't catch a break.
</p>
<p>
  Contains dragons, and may contain trace quantities of elf if you squint hard but they're all very dead.
</p>

<h3>The Legends of Ethshar series by Lawrence Watt Evans</h3>

<p>Probably the most obscure recommendation on this list.</p>

<p>
  A series of shortish novels set in an interesting and well constructed world. They're none too deep,
  but they're all enjoyable reads. They cover a bunch of fantasy tropes while managing to avoid
  either being cliched or going full blown deconstruction.
</p>

<p>
  Contains dragons and extinct elves.
</p>

<h3>The Steerswoman Series by Rosemary Kirstein</h3>

<p>OK, this one is a cheat. It's totally not fantasy, but is in fact science fiction.</p>

<p>
  This is despite the fact that it is mostly a sword and sorcery series about evil manipulative wizards.
</p>

<p>
  However I include it here because a) It's really good and b) Its very nature might make it a
  good gateway fantasy novel.
</p>

<h3>The Furies of Calderon by Jim Butcher</h3>

<p>
  This is not the Jim Butcher series that everyone will recommend you read (that would be
  "The Dresden Files", but I consider the Kate Daniels books a much better intro to that class of fantasy).
</p>

<p>
  Roman derived culture with magic. A certain amount of political intrigue. Quite a lot of war.
  An alien invasion to fight off.
</p>

<h3>The Magister Trilogy by Celia Friedman</h3>

<p>
  Celia Friedman's general schtick is deals with the devil (generally not the actual
  devil, though in one other series it comes pretty close) to save the world.
</p>


<p>
  In this world magic is done by literally draining your life - magic users tend not
  to last very long, dying of old age in their late 30s if they push themselves too hard.
  There is however one group called the magisters who can somehow do magic without.
</p>

<p>
  By <em>complete coincidence</em> there is also this mysterious wasting disease that
  affects some of the population.
</p>

<h3>The Craft Sequence by Max Gladstone</h3>
<p>
  Magic as a metaphor for economics. This is really more a collection of same world
  novels than a series per se. The first book is basically a law procedural with necromancers.
</p>

<h3>The Guards books by Terry Pratchett</h3>

<p>
  Discworld in general is good, but I regard the Guards books (Starting with "Guards! Guards!")
  as some of the best of them, and generally a very good intro to how Pratchett's use of
  fantasy for social commentary.
</p>

<h2>And the rest</h2>

<p>
  This is just a fairly random cross section of fantasy books I like that I think make good
  intros and cover a good segment of fantasy while escaping Tolkien almost entirely.
  There are plenty of others, though I'd probably say that if you don't like any of these
  fantasy might not be your genre (and that's fine).
