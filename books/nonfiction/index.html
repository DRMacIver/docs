title: Non-fiction I recommend
---

<p>
  A collection of books that have shaped my thinking in some way.
</p>

<p>
  This is a bit of a weird category to have because it's so general. It's also... distressingly short. I need
  to read more long-form non-fiction. Instead I mostly read essays and blog posts.
</p>

<p>
This is Haidt presenting his <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Foundations_Theory>Moral Foundations Theory</a>,
the basic idea of which is that there are a number of distinct axes to morality which people prioritize differently.
</p>

<p>
  I find moral foundations theory very useful. I don't know whether it's <em>true</em>, but it's an excellent
  mental model to work with to convince yourself of the plausibility of someone genuinely believing a thing.
  This is especially useful if you find yourself often wondering whether anyone could <em>really</em>
  believe what they're claiming to.

<p>
  This is an excellent light read about one of my favourite topics: External complements to thinking. It's both
  a deconstruction of the idea that "the internet is making you stupid" and also summarizes a bunch of good
  information on how we learn.

<p>
  A mix of research and anecdotes on what makes a great professor. For some reason I never really got into the companion book,
 <a href=http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0674066642/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0674066642&linkCode=as2&tag=darma-21>What The Best College Students Do</a>.
</p>

<p>I am currently reading <a href=http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0674729013/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0674729013&linkCode=as2&tag=darma-21>Making It Stick</a>,
which may replace this recommendation when I've finished.</p>

<p>
I confess it's been a long time since I've read this book, but it's an excellent introduction to mathematical thinking.
</p>

<p>
  This is something of a qualified recommendation, as it's a very dense read, but it's informed a lot of my thinking.
</p>

<p>
  It's essentially about how attempts to make sense of a society and make it "legible" change it, and why many
  high handed attempts to improve efficiency make the world worse.

<p>
  This is a bit of a weird recommendation. It's actually originally a recommendation from my brother, who studied
  this subject for his masters.
</p>

<p>
  It's somewhere between a textbook on naturalized epistemology (epistemology is the study of human knowledge.
  Naturalized epistemology is epistemology done as if it were a science) and a polemic against the classic study
  of epistemology, but as such it manages to be an excellent and fairly approachable introduction to the 
  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristics_in_judgment_and_decision-making>heuristics and biases</a>
  program.
</p>

<p>
  It also taught me a lot about interviewing people and how to run a hospital.
