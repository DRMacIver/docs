<ol>
	<li>Musician's ear plugs. These are <em>so good</em>. If you have any sort of trouble in loud bars you need to get yourself a pair of these. They cut out general ambient noise while mostly not filtering conversational noise. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004SBSOKK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B004SBSOKK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">You should get these ones</a>. I've tried 3 or 4 brands at this point and these ones are amazing and the others I've tried vary from OK to useless. People spotting that I was wearing these and going "You have literally changed my life" when I explained them is the major thing that prompted me to write this post.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00KDRUCJY/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00KDRUCJY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">Kindle</a>. I read probably somewhere in the region of ten million words of fiction per year. This used to be a major problem - a lot of my travel weight allowance always went on books, because otherwise I'd run out mid travel! Then I found out I could have a book store in my pocket and, well. I do not leave home without my Kindle if I can possibly help it. Note. You will probably want a case for this. I have the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B008BQH1NO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B008BQH1NO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">standard hard leather case</a>. I don't know about the paperwhite, but my previous kindles were very non-durable without a case.</li>
	<li>External battery for phone and kindle. I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00OJXVDAU/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00OJXVDAU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">RAVPower</a>. The Kindle has a long enough battery life that this is <em>mostly</em> for the phone or for when I forget the Kindle. Phones running out of battery is <a href="https://xkcd.com/903/">awful</a>. This battery is huge but lasts me probably 6 or 7 phone charges, so I only need to remember to charge it once a week.</li>
	<li>USB cables to go with the above. I'm <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00RQ5AZJ8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00RQ5AZJ8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">using these ones</a>, which were recommended to me as giving great charging time, though I find they don't always stay in my phone very well (other devices such as kindle and battery are fine).</li>
	<li>A water bottle. I have a metal <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006PTIUIE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B006PTIUIE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">Siggs</a> which is great. I like hydration, but hate disposable plastic. The 0.4 litre size seems pretty good to me - I rarely run out of water for casual use with this size, but it also doesn't add too much to the weight.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00BY6FPFY/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00BY6FPFY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">Nail Clippers</a> (generic link. I don't actually have specifically these ones). My nails splinter a lot, and it's so annoying to not have these to hand and they take up basically no room.</li>
	<li>Ear Phones. Sometimes you just don't want to listen to your surroundings. I like <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00L3KSKYY/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00L3KSKYY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">the Amazon Basics ones</a>.</li>
	<li>A key ring to tie things together. I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00CAJN9D4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00CAJN9D4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">these ones</a>. They're super cheap, fit a lot, and are generally very useful.</li>
	<li>USB flash drive. I have <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00NN8EWAU/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00NN8EWAU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">this one</a>, which is great and can just go on a key chain. It's ambiguously useful because I don't think I've used it since I put it there. I thought I would use this all the time, but it turns out I just don't need a USB key.</li>
	<li>LED flashlight. I need to see in the dark sometimes, and the phone flashlight basically nukes the battery. Hence a flashlight. The one I have is fairly bulky. I have something that's a slightly cheaper version of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00NPXCB7E/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00NPXCB7E&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">this</a>. I'm considering downgrading to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B009WJR89Q/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B009WJR89Q&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">a tiny key ring one</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000SM5HWQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B000SM5HWQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">Hip Flask</a>. I carry this around because I have fairly specific tastes in drinks and am often in places that can't satisfy them. (Basically I don't really drink beer or wine much and am a spirits snob). So I thought carrying a hip flask of decent whiskey around would be a good idea. Problem is it turns out I hardly drink these days, and when I do it tends to be in places that will serve me good cocktails. So that's not very useful after all.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0001EFSTI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B0001EFSTI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=darma-21">Utili-key</a>. Turns out I do carry a leatherman-ish around with me all the time. I've never used it, and that's not just because I'm bad at opening it.</li>
