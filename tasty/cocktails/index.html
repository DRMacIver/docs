excerpt: Making tasty cocktails
---

<p>
My drinking is pretty variable. Right now I hardly drink at all (I think I'm averaging <em>maybe</em> two units a week), but when I do
it tends to be cocktails.
</p>

<p>
  Most of the cocktails I make fit what I think of as the minimum viable cocktail: Take three ingredients, mix
  them together (probably in equal parts), serve over ice. Anything simpler wouldn't count as a cocktail. At any
  given point there tend to be only one or two I regularly make. The following are the current ones:
</p>

<h3>Armagnac Sidecar</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 part Armagnac (I've been using <a href="http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/gb/groceries/sainsburys-armagnac--taste-the-difference-50cl?langId=44&storeId=10151&krypto=aI%2BIkYG%2FFJ2SSb0VCPVFgfWHSvU1quIn1IdwPprUzcGUpjedjwO3v1FyrVeF0sEnXIguHRxwUkuF%0AU5eN9T264H083f3J7iCHxzmIObkyWuP7F9z0TvZlBs4J4b72Qqz0&ddkey=http:gb/groceries/sainsburys-armagnac--taste-the-difference-50cl">Sainsbury's Taste the Difference</a> for this. It's actually pretty good.</li>
<li>1 part triple sec (I use <a href="http://www.boudier.com/en/majeur/">Gabriel Boudier</a>. I used to use Cointreau but honestly I can't taste the difference in this drink)</li>
<li>1 part freshly squeezed lemon juice.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is a bit on the sweet side, but the sharpness of the lemon offsets that nicely, and the Armagnac makes it
  quite interesting. This is the current house cocktail that everyone insists I make for them despite my repeatedly
  telling them that it's literally the simplest thing in the world.
</p>

<h3>Hanky Panky</h3>

<ul>
  <li>1 part sweet vermouth (<a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-14383.aspx">Cocchi vermouth di Torino</a> is great for this. Also for everything else).</li>
  <li>1 part gin (I just use Tanqueray or Beefeater)</li>
  <li>About half a cap full of Fernet Branca</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is somewhere between a slightly augmented Gin and It and a Negroni. I really like it. Easy on the Fernet
  though - you're really using it as a bitter. It accents the drink. If you use a lot it will just dominate it.
