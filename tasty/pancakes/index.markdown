### Ingredients

* 1/2 cup flour
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp cream of tartar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 cup of yoghurt
* 1/4 cup of milk.
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp vegetable oil

### Cooking

1. Put all the liquid ingredients into a bowl.
2. Stir until reasonably well mixed.
3. Add all the dry ingredients in. 
4. Stir again until reasonably well mixed (you don’t need to get all the lumps out – just the big ones).
5. Cook them on a nonstick frying pan (no oil!) on a medium-low heat.
6. When a pancake is ready to be flipped it will start bubbling. The other side should be golden brown.
7. Serve with butter, and maple syrup if you like.
