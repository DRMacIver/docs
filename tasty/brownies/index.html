excerpt: The objectively best brownie recipe
---

<p>
  Note: Cups here are US cups. i.e. about 240ml
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>One pat butter (I think these are 250g)</li>
	<li>Two cups granulated white sugar</li>
	<li>One cup cocoa. The darker the better. Use the best you can find - these brownies live or die on the quality of their cocoa</li>
	<li>One cup flour</li>
	<li>Four eggs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>

<p>
  Melt the butter. Stir in the sugar and the cocoa until it's thoroughly mixed. Add the flour and eggs
  and stir further.
</p>

<p>
  Decant the whole mix into a greased baking tray (I usually make these about half an inch deep).
  Bake at 160C for about 20 minutes. Check the brownies religiously towards the end. If you overcook
  these they will be too dry (still tasty, but less delicious). The brownies are ready when you can
  stick a knife in the middle and it comes out clean.
