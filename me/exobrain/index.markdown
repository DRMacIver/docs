excerpt: Stuff I use to get things done
---

I have twomain tools I use to manage my time and encourage me to get things done.

1. [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/)
2. [Tagtime](https://github.com/dreeves/TagTime) (the Android app)

## Tagtime

The general concept behind Tagtime is that it does stochastic sampling of your time to see how you spend it.

It is in a sense the only honest way to do time tracking - if I'm not currently paying attention when the
buzzer goes off, I don't count it.

It turns out a distressingly small fraction of time is spent actually doing useful things.

Currently my main Tagtime use is just a binary "Is what I'm currently doing useful?", where useful is a bit woolly
in its definition but includes work, chores, etc.


## Beeminder

The main non-tagtime goals I have set up with Beeminder are:

1. Update these docs (tracked with Gitminder)
2. Do exercise.

### Exercise

The way my exercise beeminding works is as follows:

Firstly, I have a notion of "a unit of exercise". This is either seven minutes of running or 40 of any body
weight exercise (pushups, leg raises or squats mainly).

I additionally have goals for number of pushups done per week and total amount of running.
