title: A collection of useful concepts
---

<p>
 This is a general collection of things that I find very useful concepts to know about because they
 make you aware of aspects of the world you'd miss and give you tools for thinking about it, along with links
 to good articles on the subject.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance>Pluralistic Ignorance</a>, when most people 
    know something, or reject a norm, but don't know that most other people do too and thus the norm continues.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href=http://www.rapp.org/archives/2015/12/normalization-of-deviance/>Normalization of Deviance</a> - how
    breaking the rules can become a norm.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href=http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm>The Tyranny of Structurelessness</a> - you can't get rid
    of structures in a group, you can only decide whether you want them to be legible or not.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href=http://mkremins.github.io/blog/doors-headaches-intellectual-need/>Problem-solution ordering issues.</a>
      - introducing a solution before you introduce the problem will generally lead to confused students.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactive_memory>Transactive memory</a> - sometimes you remember
    things, but sometimes you just remember how to remember them (who to ask, what to Google, etc).
  </li>
</ul>
