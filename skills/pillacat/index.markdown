excerpt: Notes on pilling a cat
---

I'm reasonably good at giving medicine to cat. The exact strategy varies
a lot from cat to cat, particularly depending on the strength and
temperament of the cat, and the nature of the medicine.

Here are a couple of techniques that help:

1. Wrap the cat in a towel. Cats are covered in pointy things that they
   will use to great effect on you, even if they don't mean it and are
   just panicking.
2. Scruffing works very well on cats of all shapes and sizes. Grab them
   by the back of the neck with one hand while you put the pill in their
   mouth (this significantly reduces the chances of them trying to chow
   down on your hand too).
3. Using a pipette dropper of water to squirt into their mouth after you've
   put the pill in there, then hold their mouth shut to make them swallow.
   Make sure you're holding the cat firmly when you do this, otherwise the
   first time you try you might find your cat has teleported across the room.

Additional notes:

1. If you have a moderately strong cat, it's going to be *very* hard to
   pill them on your own. A second person is very very helpful even with
   a weak cat. One person does cat control, the other applies medicine
   and/or water.
2. Scruffing may not be possible. For example, some medicine you need to apply
   to the back of the neck. When it's not, holding them down with thumbs on
   both shoulder blades seems to work a bit though not *as* well.
3. Make sure to check for pill hiding. Cats will often keep the pill in their
   mouth and then spit it out later. The water and holding their mouth shut helps
   a lot at preventing this.
4. Don't be afraid to use quite a lot of strength. Cats are robust.
5. Your cat isn't actually going to hate you for this, at least not for more than
   about 10 minutes.
